# Automatic-Three-Way-Pnematic-Dumper-Mechanism

# OVERVIEW: 
A dumper is a vehicle designed for carrying bulk material, often on building sites. Dumpers are 
distinguished from dump trucks by configuration: a dumper is usually an open 4-wheeled vehicle with 
the load skip in front of the driver, while a dump truck has its cab in front of the load. The skip can tip 
to dump the load; this is where the name "dumper" comes from. They are normally diesel powered. A 
towing eye is fitted for secondary use as a site tractor. Dumpers with rubber tracks are used in special 
circumstances and are popular in some countries. 
Early dumpers had a payload of about a ton and were 2-wheel drive, driving on the front axle and 
steered at the back wheels. The single cylinder diesel engine (sometimes made by Lister) was started 
by hand cranking. The steering wheel turned the back wheels, not front. Having neither electrics nor 
hydraulics there was not much to go wrong. The skip was secured by a catch by the driver's feet. When 
the catch is released, the skip tips under the weight of its contents at pivot points below, and after being 
emptied is raised by hand. 

This project addresses the limitations of conventional dumpers by introducing a pneumatic system for material
 unloading in three directions. The current method, with a hydraulic system pushing materials only to the rear,
 proves inconvenient in compact spaces and small streets due to limited turning radius. The proposed solution
 utilizes compressed air to actuate cylinders, enabling efficient and convenient material dumping in various
 directions. This innovation aims to streamline the unloading process, making it smoother and more adaptable to
 different environments.

 # AIM / OBJECTIVE: 
Our aim is to design and develop this project in such a way that, the dumper is able to dump the 
material in all three possible direction in a very less time & available space in a convenient way with a 
minimum cost and maximum output. 
➢ To achieve high safety 
➢ To reduce man power 
➢ To increase the efficiency of the vehicle 
➢ To reduce the work load 
➢ To reduce the fatigue of workers 
➢ To get maximum output with minimum cost 
➢ Low maintenance cost
